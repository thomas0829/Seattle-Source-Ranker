# Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)

> A data-driven tool that identifies and ranks the most influential open-source projects from the Seattle area by analyzing GitHub repository metrics.

üåê **Live Demo**: [https://thomas0829.github.io/Seattle-Source-Ranker](https://thomas0829.github.io/Seattle-Source-Ranker)

---

## üåé Overview

**Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)** is a comprehensive tool designed to discover and rank influential open-source projects where the owner/maintainer is located in the Seattle metropolitan area (including Seattle, Redmond, Bellevue, Kirkland, and surrounding Washington cities).

The tool fetches popular GitHub repositories, verifies owner locations, and calculates multi-dimensional influence scores to identify the most impactful projects from the Seattle tech community.

---

## üß† Motivation

The Seattle area hosts one of the world's most vibrant tech communities, with thousands of developers contributing to open-source projects. However, it's challenging to:
- Identify which projects are actually maintained by Seattle-area developers
- Measure project influence beyond simple star counts
- Understand the health and sustainability of these projects

SSR solves these problems by providing objective, multi-metric analysis of Seattle-based open-source contributions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### **Influence Score Formula**

SSR uses a comprehensive scoring model that considers five key dimensions:

```
Score = 0.4 √ó S_norm + 0.25 √ó F_norm + 0.15 √ó W_norm + 0.10 √ó T_age + 0.10 √ó H_health
```

#### **Component Breakdown:**

| Metric | Weight | Description | Formula |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **S_norm** | 40% | **Normalized Stars** - Community popularity and visibility | stars / max_stars |
| **F_norm** | 25% | **Normalized Forks** - Community engagement and contribution level | forks / max_forks |
| **W_norm** | 15% | **Normalized Watchers** - Long-term interest and active followers | watchers / max_watchers |
| **T_age** | 10% | **Project Age Weight** - Maturity and longevity bonus | years / (years + 2) |
| **H_health** | 10% | **Health Score** - Project maintenance quality | 1 - (open_issues / (open_issues + 10)) |

#### **Why These Weights?**

- **Stars (40%)**: Primary indicator of community recognition and project popularity
- **Forks (25%)**: Shows active contribution and real-world usage
- **Watchers (15%)**: Indicates sustained interest and monitoring
- **Age (10%)**: Rewards established, proven projects
- **Health (10%)**: Ensures projects are well-maintained and actively managed

### **Location Verification**

The tool identifies Seattle-area developers by:
1. Searching GitHub's API for repositories with high star counts
2. Checking owner profiles for location data
3. Matching against Seattle-area keywords: seattle, redmond, bellevue, kirkland, washington
4. Caching results to minimize API calls

## üöÄ Usage

### **Prerequisites**

1. Obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Generate a new token with public_repo scope
   
2. Set the token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token_here'
   ```

### **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomas0829/Seattle-Source-Ranker.git
cd Seattle-Source-Ranker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running the Tool**

Basic usage:
```bash
python main.py
```

With custom parameters:
```bash
python main.py --location Seattle --topk 50 --max-pages 20
```

#### **Command-Line Options:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| --location | Seattle | Target location keyword |
| --topk | 50 | Number of top repositories to collect |
| --max-pages | 20 | Maximum GitHub API pages to fetch (100 repos/page) |

### **Output**
