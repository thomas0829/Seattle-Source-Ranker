# Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)# Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)



> A data-driven tool that identifies and ranks the most influential open-source projects from the Seattle area by analyzing GitHub repository metrics.> Tool that analyzes GitHub and PyPI data to identify and rank the most influential open-source projects in Seattle, measuring both community reputation and real-world adoption.



------



## üåé Overview## üåé Overview



**Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)** is a comprehensive tool designed to discover and rank influential open-source projects where the owner/maintainer is located in the Seattle metropolitan area (including Seattle, Redmond, Bellevue, Kirkland, and surrounding Washington cities).**Seattle-Source-Ranker (SSR)** is a data-driven tool that identifies and ranks the most influential open-source software projects in the Seattle area.  

It integrates data from **GitHub** and **PyPI** APIs to measure both **community reputation** (e.g., stars, forks, contributors) and **real-world adoption** (e.g., downloads).  

The tool fetches popular GitHub repositories, verifies owner locations, and calculates multi-dimensional influence scores to identify the most impactful projects from the Seattle tech community.

This project helps developers, students, and organizations explore the Seattle tech ecosystem through objective metrics and trend analysis.

## üß† Motivation

## üß† Motivation

The Seattle area hosts one of the world's most vibrant tech communities, with thousands of developers contributing to open-source projects. However, it's challenging to:

- Identify which projects are actually maintained by Seattle-area developersThe open-source community in Seattle is large and dynamic, but it‚Äôs hard to know **which projects truly matter**.  

- Measure project influence beyond simple star countsSSR aims to solve this by:

- Understand the health and sustainability of these projects- Quantifying project influence through measurable metrics  

- Providing insights into growth trends and ecosystem health  

SSR solves these problems by providing objective, multi-metric analysis of Seattle-based open-source contributions.- Enabling comparisons across projects, languages, and time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology



### **Influence Score Formula**SSR uses a **two-dimensional influence model** combining social and usage signals:



SSR uses a comprehensive scoring model that considers five key dimensions:| Source | Focus | Example Metrics |

|--------|--------|----------------|

```| **GitHub API** | Community influence | Stars, forks, contributors, commits |

Score = 0.4 √ó S_norm + 0.25 √ó F_norm + 0.15 √ó W_norm + 0.10 √ó T_age + 0.10 √ó H_health| **PyPI API** | Real-world usage | Package downloads |

```

These metrics are combined into an **Influence Score**, representing both visibility and adoption.

#### **Component Breakdown:**

---

| Metric | Weight | Description | Formula |

|--------|--------|-------------|---------|## üß© Features

| **S_norm** | 40% | **Normalized Stars** - Community popularity and visibility | `stars / max_stars` |

| **F_norm** | 25% | **Normalized Forks** - Community engagement and contribution level | `forks / max_forks` |- üìä **Influence Ranking** ‚Äì Ranks projects by combined GitHub and PyPI metrics  

| **W_norm** | 15% | **Normalized Watchers** - Long-term interest and active followers | `watchers / max_watchers` |- üîç **Cross-language Analysis** ‚Äì Designed to extend beyond Python (JavaScript, Java, Rust, etc.)  

| **T_age** | 10% | **Project Age Weight** - Maturity and longevity bonus | `years / (years + 2)` |- üßÆ **Configurable Weights** ‚Äì Define how much each metric contributes to the overall influence score  

| **H_health** | 10% | **Health Score** - Project maintenance quality | `1 - (open_issues / (open_issues + 10))` |- üìà **Trend Analysis** ‚Äì Track star growth rate, fork trends, and contributor activity over time  

- üí° **Insight Summaries** ‚Äì Identify shared traits among top influential projects  

#### **Why These Weights?**

---

- **Stars (40%)**: Primary indicator of community recognition and project popularity

- **Forks (25%)**: Shows active contribution and real-world usage## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Watchers (15%)**: Indicates sustained interest and monitoring

- **Age (10%)**: Rewards established, proven projects- **Python 3.10+**

- **Health (10%)**: Ensures projects are well-maintained and actively managed- **APIs:** GitHub REST API, PyPI JSON API  

- **Libraries:** `requests`, `pandas`, `click`, `pytest`

### **Location Verification**- **Future Frontend:** React + Chart.js (for visualization prototype)



The tool identifies Seattle-area developers by:---

1. Searching GitHub's API for repositories with high star counts

2. Checking owner profiles for location data## üìÅ Project Structure

3. Matching against Seattle-area keywords: `seattle`, `redmond`, `bellevue`, `kirkland`, `washington`

4. Caching results to minimize API calls```
